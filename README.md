# NLP-with-Disaster-Tweets
Machine Learning
Developed, built and fine-tuned large language model for "Global Disaster Response" to sift through 10,000 tweets and distinguish between genuine disaster reports and non-disaster-related discussions with goal to enhance organization's crisis management capabilities by significantly improving accuracy of tweet classification during emergencies. Given the challenge of discerning the intended meaning of ambiguous language in tweets, the model utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze textual content, extracting features and patterns for accurate classification.
